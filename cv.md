### Briefly About Myself:

I have a diploma of higher technical education in the field of the construction of refrigeration machines.

I started my career as an engineer, calculating the performance of refrigeration machines and their composition. After 10 years, I work for a representative office of an Italian company, it produces insulation for engineering systems. New products are rare, and the dealer network is well established, I had time to study something new for mysel.

I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth,<br>
besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.<br>

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.<br>
